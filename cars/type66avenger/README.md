# QUADRA TYPE 66 FROM CYBERPUNK 2077

This is my first ever car release since it's the first time I'm converting a car from another game, it took me approximately 3 weeks (70+ hours) and it's finally done ![:smiling_face_with_three_hearts:](https://forum.cfx.re/images/emoji/twitter/smiling_face_with_three_hearts.png?v=10 ":smiling_face_with_three_hearts:")

*It was really challenging since Cyberpunk don't use textures a lot and it has other issues converting the model into ZModeler3, but I'm really happy with the results*
